# Real-time-temperature-detection


This code captures thermal images from the default camera device, applies thresholding to highlight the warmer areas, and calculates the temperature of each region using a conversion formula. The resulting temperature and bounding rectangle for each region are displayed in the image window. You can modify the thresholding and temperature calculation parameters according to your needs. Note that the specific settings required for your thermal camera may vary depending on the camera model and driver used.
